## Course 2: Code, Build, and Test

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

DevOps process can be visualized as an infinite loop, comprising these steps: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. This course in the DevOps on AWS specialization focuses on code, build and test parts of the workflow. We will discuss topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated.

**Week 1**

This week, you will be introduced to DevOps cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that you can use to deliver applications and services faster and at a higher quality. Building off this knowledge, you will get hands-on with AWS services, such as AWS Cloud9, by setting up a development environment for a sample application.

Learning Objectives
- Describe how the DevOps model benefits development and operations teams
- Explain DevOps cultural philosophies, practices, and tools
- Use AWS Cloud9 to set up your development environment
- Explore how you can use AWS CodeBuild to build and test code with continuous scaling
- Evaluate Git branching strategies

**Week 2**

In the second week, you will discover why it’s important for teams to incorporate testing into the software development lifecycle at different stages of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. You will get hands-on with AWS solutions by performing various application tests with AWS CodeBuild, automate your release process with AWS CodePipeline, and automate code deployments with AWS CodeDeploy.

Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between unit tests and integration tests
- Describe the benefits of automated testing
- Run unit tests in AWS CodeBuild and view log output
- Differentiate between continuous integration and continuous delivery
- Create a new pipeline using AWS CodePipeline
- Automate the SAM deploy


## Course 3: Release and Deploy

AWS provides a set of flexible services designed to enable companies to more rapidly and reliably build and deliver products using AWS and DevOps practices. These services simplify provisioning and managing infrastructure, deploying application code, automating software release processes, and monitoring your application and infrastructure performance. 

The third course in the series explains how to improve the deployment process with DevOps methodology, and also some tools that might make deployments easier, such as Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, and AWS CodeDeploy.

The course begins with reviewing topics covered in the first course of the DevOps on AWS series. You will learn about the differences between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. In Exercises 1 and 2, you will set up AWS CodeDeploy and make revisions that will then be deployed. If you use AWS Lambda, you will explore ways to address additional considerations when you deploy updates to your Lambda functions.

Next, you will explore how infrastructure as code (IaC) helps organizations achieve automation, and which AWS solutions provide a DevOps-focused way of creating and maintaining infrastructure. In Exercise 3, you will be provided with an AWS CloudFormation template that will set up backend services, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodeBuild. You will then upload new revisions to the pipeline.
